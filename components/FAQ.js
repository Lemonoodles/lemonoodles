				<Accordian title='What are Lemonoodles?'>
					<p>
						Lemonoodles are a collection of unique, programmatically generated
						frens inspired by Little Lemon Friends and Doodles. We like the
						lemons and we like the doodles. Turns out they liked each other too.
						These are their love children and a story of forbidden love.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note, the art for Lemonoodles is completely our own and each trait
						has been hand drawn. The project is only inspired by and not
						affiliated with Doodles or Little Lemon Friends.
					</p>
				</Accordian>
				<Accordian title='How many Lemonoodles are there?'>
					<p>7,777</p>
				</Accordian>
				<Accordian title='Will there be rarity?'>
					<p>
						The Lemonoodles are generated from 150 traits with varying degrees
						of rarity. Combinations of those traits and rarities will determine
						the ranking of each Lemonoodle

						Yes! To reward the communities of our inspiration projects and save

						our community and will be rewarding other spots based on activity
						and overall encouragement of others!!

						LEMONLIST role in the Discord you also are WL'd. Please please

				<Accordian title='Is there a launch roadmap?'>
					<p>
						We're all about being chill here. Unlike other projects we're not
						really into creating artificial hype, promising the world, and then
						delivering nothing! We have a capable team that can build almost
						anything imaginable! We want to leave that up to you as a community
						to decide though! See the Lemon-Map channel for more updates!
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the project is sold out we MAY have a few surprises and
						giveaways ðŸ˜‰ for those that hang around the Discord!
					</p>

				<Accordian title='What commercial rights do I have to my Lemonoodles?'>
					<p>
						You are free to do whatever you want with your Lemonoodle!! The IP
						is yours!!
					</p>
					<p>
						Lemonoodles are in the Public Domain. To the extent possible under
						law, we have waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights
