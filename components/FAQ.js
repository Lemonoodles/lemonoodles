				<Accordian title='What are Lemonoodles?'>
					<p>
						Lemonoodles are a collection of unique, programmatically generated
						frens inspired by Little Lemon Friends and Doodles. We like the
						lemons and we like the doodles. Turns out they liked each other too.
						These are their love children and a story of forbidden love. Note,
						the art for Lemonoodles is completely our own and is only inspired
						by and not affiliated with Doodles or Little Lemon Friends.
					</p>
				</Accordian>
				<Accordian title='How many Lemonoodles are there?'>
					<p>7,777</p>
				</Accordian>
				<Accordian title='Will there be rarity?'>
					<p>
						The Lemonoodles are generated from 150 traits with varying degrees
						of rarity. Combinations of those traits and rarities will determine
						the ranking of each Lemonoodle

				<Accordian title='Is there a launch roadmap?'>
					<p>
						We're all about being chill here. Unlike other projects we're not
						really into promising the world and delivering nothing! This is a
						community driven project at its core and major decisions will be
						made by YOU the community! Once the project is sold out we may have
						a few surprises for those that hang around the Discord! After
						community feedback on further direction we will be hosting a series
						of votes in the verified Lemonoodles polls channel.
					</p>

				<Accordian title='What commercial rights do I have to my Lemonoodles?'>
					<p>
						You are free to do whatever you want with your Lemonoodle!! The IP
						is yours!! Lemonoodles are in the Public Domain. To the extent
						possible under law, we have waived all copyright and related or
						neighboring rights to Lemonoodles. We believe that by releasing the
						works under CC0 we allow the community to freely build upon, enhance
						and reuse the works for any purposes without fear or restriction
						under copyright and database law
